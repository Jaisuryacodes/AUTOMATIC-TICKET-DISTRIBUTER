Abstract:
        Bus transportation is one of the main transportation systems in India. The passengers are increasing day by day, 
        so it is important to make their journey more comfortable and easy. Therefore, we are introducing a system called 
        E-Ticket which helps the passengers to get the ticket in one swipe. The system contains components like Arduino, 
        LCD, Sim Module, RFID Reader/Writer. When the passengers swipe the card while they are enter and exit the location 
        is read and the distance will be calculated and the amount is directly paid through net-banking. The information 
        acknowledged to the passengers to their mobile phone and receipt. The system is also used to calculate the number
         of passengers inside the bus.
